# SENSEI in situ interface and Catalyst in situ infrastructure

SENSEI: "Write once, use everywhere" 

Catalyst: live visualzation and co-processing

We present the immersive simulation software infrastructure, demonstrating the linkages between solver and co-processing tools to enable livei, reconfigerable visualization and live, reconfigurable problem definition. 

We use the PDE Solver is the fluid solver PHASTA. The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate relationship between Solver and immersive simulation tools.
