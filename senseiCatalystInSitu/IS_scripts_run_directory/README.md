# SENSEI scripts in run directory

1. diffuser_pipeline.py
    - Custom Catalyst ParaView pipeline python script. Generated via the ParaView GUI, this script determines the recirculating region and saves this data to file. In general, you can use a Catlayst pipeline to save images, data, or launch live visualization in the ParaView GUI.  
2. senseiPhasta.xml
    - The SENSEI analysis adaptor, in this case a Catalyst analysis is enabled, but you could swap this with a different catalyst analysis, or a different in situ infrastructure alltogether such as Visit/Libsim and ADIOS.
