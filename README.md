Tools to mitigate traditional workflow inefficiences 

This repository serves as a demonstration of immersive simulation tools on a 2D agressive subsonic diffuser in the fluid solver PHASTA. 

Immersive simulation tools
1. SENSEI in situ interface
2. Catalyst in situ infrastructure
3. libEnsemble efficient ensemble generation
4. Chaospy python library for UQ techniques

# Software Tools 
## Ensemble Generation

Implement libEnsemble with PHASTA!
  
"libEnsemble is a library to coordinate the concurrent evaluation of dyanmic     ensembles of calculations" https://libensemble.readthedocs.io/en/master/
 
In essence: if you seek to evaluate numerous PHASTA simulations on a HPC the    n this tool is for you.
